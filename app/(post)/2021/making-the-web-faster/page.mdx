## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Financial Discipline**: My accounting background taught me the importance of proper financial management
2. **Risk Assessment**: Understanding numbers helps in making informed business decisions
3. **Customer Focus**: Every business decision should ultimately serve the customer

## The Future

As I continue to grow as a founder, I'm excited to share more insights and experiences from this journey. The path from account professional to entrepreneur is unique for everyone, but the fundamentals of good business remain the same.
